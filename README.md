## Repository Structure

- **`algorithms/`**  
  Contains the source codes (implementations) of all algorithms included in the comparisons. One can find there a README.md as the introduction of how to compile and run these algorithms.

- **`instances_and_generators/`**  
  Includes scripts for generating all three benchmark sets used in the comparisons.  
  All benchmark instances are available in this directory.

- **`results/`**  
  Provides all results (single and aggregated) obtained by the different approaches.  
  This directory also includes the accompanying plots.
